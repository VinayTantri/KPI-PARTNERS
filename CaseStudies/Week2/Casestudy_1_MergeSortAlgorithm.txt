Merge Sort Algorithm

MERGE_SORT(arr, beg, end)  
if beg < end  
set mid = (beg + end)/2  
MERGE_SORT(arr, beg, mid)  
MERGE_SORT(arr, mid + 1, end)  
MERGE (arr, beg, mid, end)  
end of if    
END MERGE_SORT 

1: Divide the array into two part.
2: Divide the array into two parts again.
3: Break each element into single parts.
4: Sort the elements from smallest to largest.
5: Merge the divided sorted arrays togather.
6: The array has been sorted.
